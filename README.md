# covid_vo
Data files, code and images - analysing the published data regarding COVID19 cases in the Italian municipality of Vo'.
Theri dataset is unique in many ways. The town was quarantined, and most (cca 80%) of the population  (cca.3000 inhabitants in total) was tested for Sars-CoV2 infection (swab), at two different times. Cca. 80 tested positive. For each positive patient, data available include: age class (within a 10 years resolution), hosehold ID, symptoms, matrix of contacts (direct, indirect, household).


I adjusted the data to improve readability of XLSX (colorize/underline etc.).
Matlab code to generate input files for Gephi (graph and network visualisation).
Work in progress.
